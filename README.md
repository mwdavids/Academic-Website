# Academic Website

This is where I store the files associated with my academic website, [pages.ucsd.edu/~mwdavids](http://pages.ucsd.edu/~mwdavids)

The website is built primarily in Markdown using [Strapdown.js](strapdownjs.com) and [Strapdown+Navigation](http://smzg.github.io/strapdown/example/) (an easily added navigation bar).
